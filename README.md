# Meanion

Code for my personal learning of the MEAN stack on CodeSchool.
The following javascript libraries were used:

* MongoDB
* Express
* Angular
* Node

## Get Started

* `npm install` to resolve dependencies
* `npm install -g gulp` to install Gulp globally

## Seed Data

Run `mongoimport --db meanion --collection dances --file server/seeds/dances.json --type json --jsonArray --drop` at the root directory
